*Keep track of your progress on "Secret Fish of Mechagon" and "Secret Fish and Where to Find Them"*

I realised that I'd like to pursue these achievements, and who better than myself as a guinea pig for building this Addon? Well, yeah, based on my commit history, probably *literally anyone else*, but that's neither here nor there.

Simple little window that tracks everything you need to get your very own Hyper-Compressed Ocean! Fish anywhere! Be less miserable!
